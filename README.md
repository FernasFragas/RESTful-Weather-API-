# Weather Application

Personal project to train my golang skills

In this project I used Go to create a RESTful JSON Weather API
It allows users to retrieve the current weather conditions and forecast for a given location.
The API uses data from a weather service called OpenWeather(https://openweathermap.org/)

## Application Design

### How to run the project
- Clone the repository
- Get a token from OpenWeather(https://openweathermap.org/) and create a .env file in the root directory
- Add the token to the .env file
- Run the project with the command `go run main.go`
- The server will start on port 8080

# RESTful API in go

Personal project to train my golang skills

In this project I used Go to create a RESTful JSON Weather API
It allows users to retrieve the current weather conditions and forecast for a given location.
The API uses data from a weather service called OpenWeather(https://openweathermap.org/)

### What is a RESTful API?
- RESTful - Representational State Transfer
- Is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services
- RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an API that follows constraints and is designed to accept and return data in a standardized format

### Characteristics of an RESTful API
- uses HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.
- uses HTTP status codes
- Is stateless, meaning that each request is independent and does not depend on the state of the server or previous requests.

### Application Design
